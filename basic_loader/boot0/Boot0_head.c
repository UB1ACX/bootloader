/*******************************************************************************
*
*                  On "Boot_file_head" moderate jump_instruction field
*
* The field stores a jump instruction£º( B  BACK_OF_Boot_file_head )£¬
* After this jump instruction is executed, the program will jump to the first instruction after Boot_file_head.
*
* ARM 
* The B command in the instruction is encoded as follows£º
*          +--------+---------+------------------------------+
*          | 31--28 | 27--24  |            23--0             |
*          +--------+---------+------------------------------+
*          |  cond  | 1 0 1 0 |        signed_immed_24       |
*          +--------+---------+------------------------------+
*
* ¡¶ARM Architecture Reference Manual¡·
* The following explanation for this instruction£º
*  Syntax :
*  B{<cond>}  <target_address>
*    <cond>    Is the condition under which the instruction is executed. If the
*              <cond> is ommitted, the AL(always,its code is 0b1110 )is used.
*    <target_address>
*              Specified the address to branch to. The branch target address is
*              calculated by:
*              1.  Sign-extending the 24-bit signed(wro's complement)immediate
*                  to 32 bits.
*              2.  Shifting the result left two bits.
*              3.  Adding to the contents of the PC, which contains the address
*                  of the branch instruction plus 8.
*
* It can be seen that the highest 8 bits of this instruction code are£º 0b11101010£¬Low 24 based on "Boot_file_head" size
* State generation, so the assembly process of the instruction is as follows£º
*  ( sizeof( boot_file_head_t ) + sizeof( int ) - 1 ) / sizeof( int )
*                                              Find the number of "words" occupied by the file header
*  - 2                                         Subtract the number of instructions prefetched by the PC
*  & 0x00FFFFFF                                Find signed-immed-24
*  | 0xEA000000                                Assembled into B command
